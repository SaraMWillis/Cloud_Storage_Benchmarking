The file DuckCLI_PersonalComputer_to_GoogleDrive_Means.csv does not have a raw file as a source like the other files in this repository. This is because the original version of the script that generated these data found the means and standard errors and printed the final results rather than the intermediate step of printing each individual trial. This method was abandoned due to the numpy and scipy modules not being available on the HPC filexfer node.
